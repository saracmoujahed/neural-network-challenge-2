# Attrition Prediction Model

## Overview

This program uses a multi-output neural network to predict employee attrition and department based on various features such as education, age, job satisfaction, and work-life balance. It leverages machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow/Keras to build, train, and evaluate the model.

## Dataset

The program utilizes an attrition dataset (e.g., `attrition.csv`) containing information about employees and their attrition status. The dataset should include features relevant to attrition and the department to which the employee belongs.
